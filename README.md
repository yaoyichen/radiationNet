## Physics-Incorporated Framework for Radiative Transfer
This repo is the implementation  of the article "Physics-Incorporated Framework for Emulating Atmospheric Radiative Transfer and the Related Network Study".
We propose a physics-incorporated framework for the radiative transfer DL model, in which the physical relationship between fluxes and heating rates is encoded as a layer of the network. It is also found that the prediction accuracy was improved with the physic-incorporated layer. In addition, we trained and compared various types of deep learning model architectures, including fully connected (FC) neural networks (NNs), convolutional-based NNs (CNNs), bidirectional recurrent-based NNs (RNNs), transformer-based NNs, and neural operator networks, respectively.

##
The code description is as follows: 
- main program: main_fullyear.py
- executable scriptï¼š./script/current/runscript.py
- network structure folder: ./models/
- utils fodler: ./utils/


Checkpoints models are save in: ./checkpoints


##  How to train the model 
The following is an example script of running the LSTM model. 
```
./scripts/run_script.sh
```
The specific script file is as follows. The model structure can be selected by the argument "model_name", and the avialable model structures are "FC","RES","UNET","LSTM","GRU","FNO","ATT" etc, and the detailed description of each model can be found in our paper.
